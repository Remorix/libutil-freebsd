.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are designed to simplify access to filesystem quotas.
Quota state and quota records are accessed with the
.Fn quotactl
system call.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_open
function takes a pointer to an
.Vt fstab
entry corresponding to the filesystem on which quotas
are to be accessed.
The
.Va quotatype
field indicates the type of quotas being sought, either
.Dv USRQUOTA
or
.Dv GRPQUOTA .
The
.Va openflags
are those used by the
.Fn open
system call, usually either
.Dv O_RDONLY
if quotas are only queried, or
.Dv O_RDWR
if quota records may be updated.
The
.Dv O_CREAT
flag requests creation of the default quota data file for the selected
quota type if it does not already exist.
The default file names are
.Pa .quota.user
for
.Dv USRQUOTA
and
.Pa .quota.group
for
.Dv GRPQUOTA
at the filesystem root.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_close
function frees any storage associated with the filesystem and quota type
referenced by
.Va qf .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_on
function enables quotas for the filesystem associated with its
.Va qf
argument which may have been opened with
.Dv O_RDONLY
or
.Dv O_RDWR .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_off
function disables quotas for the filesystem associated with its
.Va qf
argument which may have been opened with
.Dv O_RDONLY
or
.Dv O_RDWR .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_read
function reads the quota from the filesystem and quota type referenced by
.Va qf
for the user (or group) specified by
.Va id
into the
.Vt dqblk
quota structure pointed to by
.Va dqb .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_write_limits
function updates the limit fields (but not the usage fields)
for the filesystem and quota type referenced by
.Va qf
for the user (or group) specified by
.Va id
from the
.Vt dqblk
quota structure pointed to by
.Va dqb .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_write_usage
function updates the usage fields (but not the limit fields)
for the filesystem and quota type referenced by
.Va qf
for the user (or group) specified by
.Va id
from the
.Vt dqblk
quota structure pointed to by
.Va dqb .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_fsname
function returns a pointer to a buffer containing the path to the root
of the file system that corresponds to its
.Va qf
argument, as listed in
.Pa /etc/fstab .
Note that this may be a symbolic link to the actual directory.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_qfname
function returns a pointer to a buffer containing the name of the
quota file that corresponds to its
.Va qf
argument.
The returned path uses the default quota filename for the selected
quota type at the filesystem root.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_maxid
function is currently not implemented and fails with
.Er ENOTSUP .
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_check_path
function checks if the specified path is within the filesystem that
corresponds to its
.Va qf
argument.
If the
.Va path
argument refers to a symbolic link,
.Fn quota_check_path
will follow it.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_convert
function is currently not implemented and fails with
.Er ENOTSUP .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the requested quota type is available for the filesystem,
.Fn quota_open
returns a pointer to a
.Vt quotafile
structure used in subsequent quota access calls.
On error,
.Dv NULL
is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_close
function does not return a value.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_check_path
function returns\~1 for a positive result and\~0 for a negative
result.
If an error occurs, it returns\~-1 and sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_read ,
.Fn quota_write_limits ,
.Fn quota_write_usage ,
.Fn quota_on ,
and
.Fn quota_off
functions return zero on success.
On error they return\~-1
and set
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.Pp
The
.Fn quota_maxid
and
.Fn quota_convert
functions return\~-1 and set
.Va errno
to
.Er ENOTSUP .
